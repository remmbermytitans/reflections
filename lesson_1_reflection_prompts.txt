How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It made it super easy to compare and contrast each change in each line.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    Having the different revisions available would allow me to make changed and edit them as needed

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Easier to go back to different revisions as you can see exactly what changed.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Because Git's repository contains your entire project and not just individual files that don't interact with one another.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    With git diff, you can see the overview (plain text) changes. With git log, you can go into great detail about the different changes.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    I feel like I can experiment more knowing that I have a good backup ready to go if needed.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    To help me build my app, Proximity/Beacon (or other name).
