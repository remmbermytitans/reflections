When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  I'd want to use a remote repository if I'm collaborating with more than just one person, or doing something open-sourced.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

  Because if you are working with another person, you dont want to have a situation in which something was pushed, while you were working on the same branch only to have your data overwritten.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

  Forks, when you want to take someone elses project, and make it your own, using GitHub
  Clones, when you want to duplicate a project, and make it your own, using your local repository
  Branches, when you want to make a copy of a project, for use by someone else or to make an experimental change.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

  Having a local copy of the last known state of the remote branch, is helpful so that when doing commits, you have the ability to perform fast-forward merges, and can compare a more accurate ancestory branch.
